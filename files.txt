Client-server app to keep track of inventory. Main functionalities include accounts payable, accounts receivable, human resource, user management and reporting. User management includes access control to the main functionalities. Main page even include a ticker system allowing messages to be conveyed to the users systematically. Simple reports are mostly available only on-screen (non crystal report).  Please vote for me or at least provide your feedback as I need to know what areas require improvement or change.

In the future, will try to use object-oriented programming style because it is a good way of programming. Will be standardising the way of reporting as well. 

Haven't tested in a real multi client environment. If anyone of you have tested it, please let me know if there are any issues of concurrency and stuff like that. Any other suggestions? Please leave your comment here! Thanks!
